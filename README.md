# BruteForce
This project is a bruteforce attack simulation it uses the wordlist, encrypts each expected password from the wordlist and compares with the given hash, if the hash is same as the encrypted password, Bingo! you have cracked the password which was encrypted  
SHA256/SHA1/MD5 are some formats in which hash could be encrypted in, 2 word files i.e wordlist.txt and hash.txt  
The following modules are used:- argsparse, sys, hashlib
